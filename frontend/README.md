# Frontend for REST API Demo
This is a simple application to register whether a student is present in class on a specific day or not. It uses the backend here: https://github.com/rasmusrim/rest-api-demo

## Configuring
If the backend does not run on http://localhost:8080, you must change the URL in config.json.

## Running
    npm install
    npm run

## How to use
To add a new student, click on the plus under the table which appears. Random names will be prefilled. Add student by clicking the check icon to the right of the text inputs.

To change whether a student is present or not, click on a day in the grid and select the appropriate value for that student.

To change or delete a student, click on the trash can or the pencil to the right of the respective student's name.
